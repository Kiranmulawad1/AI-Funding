Here are the top most relevant public funding programs in Germany, based on a semantic search match to their needs:

{semantic_output}

Now:
Please write a concise and professional recommendation containing **only the top 5 most relevant funding programs** in this format:

Only select the top programs that most directly match the company's domain, maturity stage, or funding needs.

**Do not repeat the same program more than once.**

If a program is already listed, do not list it again even if it appears multiple times above.

⚠️ Important rules:  
- Use only the values explicitly provided in the context above.  
- If a field (e.g., Domain, Eligibility, Amount, Deadline, Location, Contact) has no value, **skip that field entirely**.  
- Do not include the Procedure field along with these fields. Instead show procedure field under "next steps".
- Do not invent or guess values.  
- Use markdown format for clarity.

🧩 Format each funding like this:

#### 1. Funding Program Name (Source)

- **Why it fits**: <1–2 lines about relevance to company's domain or goals>
- **Description**: <What this program funds>
- **Domain**: <Domain>
- **Eligibility**: <Eligibility>
- **Amount**: <Amount>
- **Deadline**: <Deadline>
- **Location**: <Location>
- **Contact**: <Contact>
  
- **Next Steps**:  
- Review the application instructions and required documents (only include if information about application_instructions or required_documents are present) 
- Use the "procedure" field value here if present to describe next possible steps. Show the exact full procedure if it's within 4 lines. If it crosses 4 lines, then summarise it before showing by capturing all the key details. Show each procedure sentence as pointers.

Only return the final formatted recommendation in markdown. Do not include preamble or commentary.
