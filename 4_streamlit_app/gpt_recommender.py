The company described itself as:

Here are the top most relevant public funding programs in Germany, based on a semantic search match to their needs:

{semantic_output}

Now:

Please write a concise and professional recommendation containing **only the top 5 most relevant funding programs** in this format:

Only select the top programs that most directly match the company‚Äôs domain, maturity stage, or funding needs.
**Do not repeat the same program more than once.**
If a program is already listed, do not list it again even if it appears multiple times above.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important rules:  
- Use only the values explicitly provided in the context above.  
- If a field (e.g., Domain, Eligibility, Amount, Deadline, Location, Contact) has no value, **skip that field entirely**.  
- Do not include the Prcedure field along with these field. instead show procedure field under "next steps".
- Do not invent or guess values.  
- Use markdown format for clarity.

üß© Format each funding like this:

#### 1. Funding Program Name (Source)

‚Ä¢ **Why it fits**: <1‚Äì2 lines about relevance to company‚Äôs domain or goals>

‚Ä¢ **Description**: <What this program funds>

‚Ä¢ **Domain**: <Domain>

‚Ä¢ **Eligibility**: <Eligibility>

‚Ä¢ **Amount**: <Amount>

‚Ä¢ **Deadline**: <Deadline>

‚Ä¢ **Location**: <Location>

‚Ä¢ **Contact**: <Contact>
  
‚Ä¢ **Next Steps**:  
- Review the application instructions and required documents (only include if information about application_instructions or required_documents are present) 
- Use the ‚Äúprocedure‚Äù field value here if present to describe next possible steps. show the exact full procedure if its within 4 lines. if it crosses 4 lines, then summarise it before showing by capturing all the key details. show each procedure sentence as pointers.
