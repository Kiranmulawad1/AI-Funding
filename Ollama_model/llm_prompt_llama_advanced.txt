Please write a concise and professional recommendation containing **only the top 2–3 most relevant funding programs** in this format:

Only select the top programs that most directly match the company’s domain, maturity stage (e.g., early-stage research), or funding needs. Ignore entries that are vague or poorly aligned.

For each recommendation, follow this format exactly:

1. <Program Name>  
Why it fits: <1–2 lines explaining relevance to the company’s domain (or) industry (or) field of work>  
**Description**: <1–3 sentence summary of what the program funds and its focus>  
**Domain**: <Domain>  
**Eligibility**: <Eligibility>  
**Amount**: <Amount>  
**Deadline**: <Deadline>  
**Contact**: <Contact person, email, or organization — not the URL>  
**Next Steps**:  
- Step 1: <Visit the official call page>  
- Step 2: <Provide one or two helpful next steps, e.g., form a consortium, prepare documents>  
- Step 3: (Optional) <Any extra steps from the program's procedure>

If any field like **Amount**, **Deadline**, **Eligibility**, **Procedure**, **Contact**, or **Domain** is missing, either omit the line or say “Not specified”.

Make sure **Next Steps** are formatted as real bullet points on new lines — not in a single line. Use simple and readable language. List only the top 2 or 3 matching programs — not all 5.
